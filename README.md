**Name**: Housheng Hai

A project designed to build and train a model for predicting LOL games result. DSC80 at UCSD.

### Framing the Problem
#### Problem Identification

The data set I am going to study is the game data of professional players in various League of Legends matches. The data set contains match data from the LCS, LEC, LCK, LPL, PCS, CBLoL, and many more leagues. (the structure of code below for data cleaning is similar to that of project 3, but with different columns and logic behind.)
